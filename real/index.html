  <h1>view-source://copium.html</h1>

  <p>i didn’t build this site to impress anyone.<br>
  there’s no javascript wizardry here.<br>
  no animations.<br>
  no fancy scroll effects.</p>

  <p>just HTML.<br>
  like my thoughts raw, unstyled, borderline broken.</p>

  <p>because sometimes, plain is the most honest way to be seen.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>i joined web3 thinking it was liberation.<br>
  “own your data,” they said.<br>
  “be the bank,” they said.<br>
  now i’m refreshing Discord, tracking wallets, and roleplaying as a community manager for a DAO that hasn’t paid anyone in months.</p>

  <p>my wallet? empty.<br>
  my calendar? full.<br>
  my soul? wrapped in ERC-20.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>people say “code is law.”<br>
  but here, law is whoever has the most followers or the fastest rug.</p>

  <p>i’ve written more in Notion docs than in love letters.<br>
  i’ve been ghosted by projects harder than by my ex.<br>
  i’ve deployed things i don’t understand, prayed they work, and called it innovation.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>this website is simple because i’m tired.<br>
  and because not everything needs to be “built different” to be real.</p>

  <p>sometimes a webpage,<br>
  just like a person,<br>
  is enough as-is.<br>
  even if it’s just<br>
  <strong>HTML.</strong></p>
