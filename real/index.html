  <h1>web3 pain log</h1>

  <p>– joined web3 to escape capitalism.<br>
  now i’m broke, tired, and trading jpeg apes for serotonin.</p>

  <p>– every project says “we’re early”<br>
  but i’ve been here long enough to watch founders disappear, rebrand, then rug again.</p>

  <p>– i moderate 4 servers.<br>
  none of them pay me.<br>
  but hey, i got a role and mental illness.</p>

  <p>– i used to laugh at gas prices.<br>
  now i cry in wrapped ETH.</p>

  <p>– they said “decentralized freedom”<br>
  but i’m still waiting on my bounty from 2022.</p>

  <p>– i don’t work in web3.<br>
  i survive it.</p>

  <p>– every pitch deck says “community-first”<br>
  then launches on VC-only whitelist<br>
  and bans half the mods when price dips.</p>

  <p>– the only chain that never fails is the chain of burnout.</p>

  <p>– i started farming airdrops.<br>
  now i farm disappointment.</p>

  <p>– “wen moon?”<br>
  bro, i just want health insurance.</p>
