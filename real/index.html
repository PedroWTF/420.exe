  <h1>this page is useless. just like you.</h1>
  <h2>( written not by someone, but by everything that’s missing )</h2>

  <p>
    i didn’t build this to be understood.<br>
    i built this because everything else felt like a fucking lie.<br>
    they told me to be productive.<br>
    they told me to manifest.<br>
    they told me to smile through it.<br>
    but no one asked if i even wanted to be here.
  </p>

  <p>
    i don’t even know what the fuck i’m doing anymore. <br>
    so? i just opened vscode at 2AM.<br>
    <em>let down</em> was playing on repeat.<br>
    and this page was born. <br>
    my speaker’s broken, but somehow still louder than my thoughts.<br>
    this isn’t art. or healing.<br>
    just what happens when silence turns into a scream.
  </p>

  <p>
    no college, no fancy title.<br>
    just a guy trying to learn design, coding, music, making 3DCG, even tried painting jokowi’s face but somehow his eyes merged into one and stared back at me.<br>
    nothing worked.<br>
    i’ve tried everything but nothing sticks.
every time i think i've made progress, life whispers <span class="highlight">“nah, try again bitch.”</span>
  </p>

  <h3>some nights hit like this:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>scroll past lives you can’t afford</li>
    <li>laugh at pain that sounds too familiar</li>
    <li>feel guilty for resting</li>
    <li>post something real, then delete it</li>
    <li>exist. barely.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>how i survived? i didn’t. i just stayed conscious.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>started shit i never finished</li>
    <li>made memes out of breakdowns</li>
    <li>post weird shit at 3AM and don’t even know why.</li>
    <li>said "i'm okay" too many times</li>
    <li>raised a spider. it died in a week</li>
    <li>wrote this. just to feel something real</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    10 tabs open. 10 ideas waiting. no clue what i’m even doing here.<br>
   maybe this site is just “self-expression”<br>
   i’ll delete on my next breakdown.<br>
    if you’re still here  maybe you’re lost too.<br>
    maybe you’re just tired of pretending.<br>
    whatever the reason : thanks.<br>
    in a world this fake, presence is a miracle.
  </p>

  <h3>about me:</h3>
  <p>
    i’m <span class="dump">Pedro</span>. or something like that.<br>
    not a president. not a brand (some expensive shit stuff).<br>
    I'm just a guy trying to be better <em>lol</em>.<br>
    this page is proof i existed, even if for one weird night at 2AM.
  </p>

  <p>
    why HTML?<br>
    because i was too lazy to make it complicated.<br>
    i don’t need 12 libraries and 4 npm installs just to say “i’m not okay.”<br>
    turns out, even <em>this</em> dumb shit can be read like it matters.
  </p>

  <h3>you’ve read this far?</h3>
  <p>
    damn. either you’re really bored.<br>
    or maybe you just needed it more than you thought.<br>
    either way — you’re here.<br>
    feel free to close the tab.
    or don’t.<br>
    nothing changes either way.<br>
    but hey... for a brief moment, we connected.<br>
    and in this hyper curated world, that’s rare as fuck.
  </p>
  <h3>congrats. you just read someone’s therapy in HTML.</h3>
<p>
  you reached the end.<br>
  most people tapped out. you didn’t.<br>
  i don’t know if that’s resilience or trauma, but thanks.<br>
