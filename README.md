> this isn’t a portfolio. this is a breakdown with a `<div>`.

## ✦ what is this?

a useless website built at 2AM by a guy who:
- has no idea what he’s doing
- learned HTML just to scream into the void
- once tried painting jokowi’s face and it became cursed

this page doesn’t solve anything.  
it doesn’t sell. it doesn’t inspire.  
it just... exists. like me.  
(barely.)

## ✦ why?

because everything else felt like a f*cking lie.  
because no one asked if i even wanted to be here.  
because productivity culture can suck my `<body>` tag.

## ✦ features

- handcrafted `<ul>` of existential despair
- terminal simulator with horny sound effects
- dark mode for darker thoughts
- spiritual wormhole disguised as a button that opens... nothing.
